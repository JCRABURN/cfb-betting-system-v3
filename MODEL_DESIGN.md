# CFB Betting Model — Design Doc (in progress)

> Purpose: this is the design spec for the prediction-model phase of the
> cfb-betting-system. It is being written during a design conversation
> and will be handed to Claude Code as a build spec once complete.
> **Design first, build second.** Nothing here gets built until the
> section is marked APPROVED.

## 0. Where the project stands (context for Claude Code)

Data foundation is complete and committed:

- SQLite DB at `data/cfb.db`, 7 seasons (2019–2025), joining cleanly by `game_id`.
- Tables: `games` (4,952 rows), `team_game_stats` (SP+, EPA, success rate,
  havoc rate), `betting_lines` (25,678 rows — timestamped opening + closing
  spreads/totals across multiple books), plus `weather`, `injuries`, `picks`,
  `ingestion_runs`.
- Team-name resolver in place; CFBD sources join at 100%, Odds API needs the
  mascot-stripping resolver (already built).
- `CLAUDE.md` and `ARCHITECTURE.md` document the whole system.

Full history of how this was built and verified is in `ARCHITECTURE.md`.

## 1. THE CRITICAL PROBLEM: lookahead bias in stored stats  ⚠️ BLOCKS EVERYTHING

**Finding (verified via query):** `team_game_stats` currently stores
**season-final** SP+/EPA — one row per team per season (`week`/`game_id`
NULL), from `backfill_historical_stats.py`. Confirmed:
`SELECT ... COUNT(DISTINCT sp_rating) FROM team_game_stats
WHERE season=2023 AND team='Georgia'` → `distinct_sp = 1`.

**Why this is fatal for a backtest:** SP+ is a season-long rating that reflects
the *entire* season, including the games we'd be trying to predict. Using
Georgia's final 2023 SP+ to predict their week 3 2023 game means the rating
already "knows" how week 3 (and every later week) turned out. A backtest built
on this looks excellent and is entirely fake — the edge vanishes the moment it
meets live games, where only point-in-time data exists.

This is the same failure mode as the field-name / join bugs caught earlier this
session: great-looking output that is silently, fundamentally wrong.

**The fix (data collection, not redesign):** CFBD serves *historical
point-in-time* ratings — "what was each team's SP+ as of week N of season Y."
Backfill weekly snapshots so a team goes from one row/season to one
row/team/week, each stamped with what was known at that point.
`team_game_stats` already has nullable `week`, so it supports this directly.
Same idempotent-backfill pattern already built twice this session, aimed at a
different endpoint.

**Known wrinkle (design decision, not a bug):** SP+ does not publish meaningful
weekly ratings for the first few weeks of a season — early on it leans on
preseason priors (returning production, recruiting) until real results
accumulate. How the model handles early weeks (use the prior? skip weeks 1–3?
treat separately?) is an OPEN decision — see §5.

---

## 2. BUILD ORDER (revised after the §1 finding)

The point-in-time backfill moves ahead of the harness — the harness has nothing
honest to measure until the underlying data is point-in-time.

1. **Point-in-time weekly stats backfill** ← real first build step
2. **Honest backtest harness** (lookahead-safe; CLV as first-class metric)
3. **Dead-simple baseline** (SP+/EPA only) — the reference every feature must beat
4. **Features, one at a time**, each measured against the baseline

Rationale (consistent all session): get the foundation truly right before
building on top, because a wrong foundation silently poisons everything
downstream.

---

## 3. DECISION — point-in-time backfill scope  ✅ LOCKED

**Pull SP+ and EPA weekly, all 7 seasons, point-in-time. Defer success rate
and havoc.**

- **SP+** — non-negotiable. Best single predictor, backbone of the baseline,
  and the specific stat whose season-final version poisons the backtest.
- **EPA** — comes with SP+. Same lookahead problem, and it returns from largely
  the same CFBD calls, so grabbing it in the same pass is nearly free. Leaving
  it season-final while SP+ is weekly would create a lopsided honest/dishonest
  dataset.
- **Success rate + havoc — DEFERRED.** Secondary, step-three features. Not
  needed until we're past the baseline and adding features one at a time.
  Backfilling their weekly history now = collecting/verifying data we won't
  touch for weeks, possibly for features that don't survive the baseline test.
  The backfill script will be reusable + idempotent, so adding them later is
  trivial (point the same script at those fields, re-run, idempotency fetches
  only what's missing).
- **All 7 seasons**, not a partial-year sample — a backtest needs full history
  to be meaningful. Rate limits never triggered on the last full backfill, so
  cost is low.

**Verification discipline (carry forward):** before trusting the backfill,
confirm the point-in-time CFBD field names/shape against ONE real response
(one season-week), exactly as done for every other data path this session.
Every checked path so far has had a hidden bug — assume this one does too until
a live call proves otherwise.

---

## 4. DECISION — honest backtest harness design  ✅ LOCKED

The most important piece: it determines whether every number the model ever
produces is trustworthy or fake.

### Structure: WALK-FORWARD validation (time-ordered)
Test the model the way it would actually be used — moving forward through time,
only ever looking backward. To predict week N of season Y, the model may learn
ONLY from games before that point (all prior seasons + weeks 1..N-1 of Y),
never after. Step forward week by week / season by season through all history.

**Explicitly NOT** random-shuffle 80/20 train/test. Random shuffling mixes the
timeline and lets the future leak into the past (train on a December game, then
"predict" a September game from the same season). That produces fake accuracy
that dies on live games. Walk-forward makes the leak *structurally impossible* —
time only moves one direction. Do not trust care; enforce it with structure.

### v1 simplification: retrain once per SEASON (not per week)
Train on all prior completed seasons, predict the upcoming season week by week,
then roll forward one season. Still fully lookahead-safe (only past seasons
used), much simpler to build/debug. Finer week-by-week retraining can come later
if it proves worth it.

### Line timing: predict against the OPENING line, measure CLV vs. CLOSE  ✅
- **Model input = opening line.** Earliest, softest, least-efficient number —
  where real edge lives and where CLV is maximized.
- **CLV = (opening line we'd bet) vs. (closing line market settled on).** That
  gap is the core edge signal, reported from day one.
- **Do NOT feed the closing line to the model as an input** — it reflects sharp
  money/news up to kickoff and would leak information the model shouldn't know.

**Honesty caveat (document in results, don't "fix"):** opening lines are the
hardest to actually bet live — odd hours, low early limits, fast movement. So
backtested opening-line CLV is closer to a *ceiling* than a guarantee: it proves
the model finds real edge; how much is captured live depends on execution.

**Data caveat (harness must handle explicitly):** historical opener coverage may
be spotty. If no true opener exists for a game, the harness must skip it or fall
back to the earliest available line AND FLAG it — never silently substitute a
later line and call it the opener (that quietly inflates the backtest).

### The three lookahead leaks the harness must structurally prevent
1. **Stats** — every feature strictly as-of-kickoff (this is why §3's
   point-in-time backfill exists). Walk-forward structure + point-in-time data
   are two halves of one guarantee; neither alone is sufficient.
2. **Line timing** — use opening (input) vs. closing (CLV only), per above.
3. **Season-wide aggregates** — any feature averaged/counted over the whole
   season (season averages, games-played counts, full-season coach records)
   leaks. The harness treats "is every feature strictly as-of-kickoff?" as an
   ENFORCED checklist, not a hope. This is the leak that survives even a correct
   walk-forward structure.

### Metrics reported from day one
ATS win %, flat-stake ROI, **and CLV** — all three, every run. CLV is
first-class (the timestamped opening/closing lines were stored specifically to
enable it), not a later add-on.

---

## 5. DECISION — prediction target + predict-vs-bet architecture  ✅ LOCKED

Driven by the owner's stated goals (bet the spread not winners; evaluate every
lined FBS game; professional edge-measured process; continuous improvement).

### Predict on EVERY lined FBS game — always. Separate PREDICTION from BET.
A prediction ("Georgia covers, projected margin X") and a bet ("the edge vs. the
market is big enough to risk money") are two different acts. The model makes a
graded prediction on every lined FBS game — no cherry-picking, no exceptions —
and a separate threshold decides whether that prediction is a *recommended bet*.

**Why predict on all games even when not betting (the learning argument):**
scoring only bet games trains the model on a biased slice — only games it
already thought it had edge on. It would never learn whether its "no bet"
judgments were correct, and could never discover a whole category of games it
*should* be betting (goal #9's systematic-weakness detection is impossible on
games you refuse to evaluate). Grading a prediction on every game gives a
complete report card across the entire game space.

### Prediction target
- Predict a **margin** (e.g. "Georgia by 6.2"), then compare to the locked
  spread to derive the side. Margin is richer than a bare cover/no-cover
  classification: the *size* of (predicted margin − spread) IS the edge signal
  that drives confidence and the bet/no-bet threshold. Straight-up winner is a
  byproduct, reported but secondary (goal #1).

### Confidence = edge size, not vibes
Confidence (1–5) is driven by how far the predicted margin sits from the locked
contest spread. Project Georgia −9 vs. line −3 → big edge → high confidence.
Project −3.5 vs. line −3 → rounding error → minimal edge → low confidence /
no-bet.

### Threshold splits recommendation from prediction
- Edge above cutoff → recommended bet, with confidence tier.
- Edge below cutoff → officially **"no bet"** (or lowest tier), **but the
  prediction is still recorded and graded.** Same prediction, different staking
  decision.

### This resolves the #2-vs-#10 tension (pick-everything vs. pass-when-no-edge)
- **SplashSports contest (goal #3):** must pick every game → use the prediction
  on every game (required).
- **Bankroll / edge measurement (goal #10):** use the threshold → bet only real
  edge.
- One prediction engine, two consumers. Not a compromise — both done for their
  correct purpose.

### REQUIRED: mark each pick's role in the `picks` table  ⚠️
Add a field distinguishing **recommended-bet** vs. **contest-only / no-bet**
(same discipline as the `pick_type` live/backfilled/synthetic field).
- Edge/ROI/CLV performance is measured ONLY on games that would actually have
  been bet — otherwise forced low-edge contest picks drown out the real signal
  and understate true betting ROI.
- Prediction calibration is measured on ALL predictions.
- Never let the two categories silently blend — every honest metric downstream
  depends on separating them.

### Early-season SP+ handling (from §1 wrinkle) — still OPEN
Decide: use preseason prior for weeks 1–3, skip those weeks, or flag them as
lower-confidence by rule. Defer to the baseline sitting.

---

## 5b. DATA-HONESTY BOUNDARY on "deep factors" (goal #6)  ⚠️ CRITICAL

The owner wants deep inputs: scheme fit, trench mismatches, QB quality, coaching
tendencies, travel/rest, weather, motivation, market behavior, historical ATS.
**Not all of these are derivable from current data, and the model must NOT
fabricate the ones that aren't.**

- **Available now in `cfb.db`:** SP+, EPA, success rate, havoc, lines, weather.
  SP+/EPA already capture much of what trench mismatches and QB quality *produce*
  on the field, indirectly. The v1 quantitative model runs on THESE.
- **NOT in the data:** OL-vs-DL grades, QB-quality ratings, scheme
  classifications. CFBD does not expose these in usable form. The model must NOT
  invent scheme-fit or trench numbers it cannot derive (this is the
  "havoc-rate-for-offense" fabrication trap — a made-up feature the model then
  weights).
- **Resolution:** v1 predicts from the metrics that exist. Richer qualitative
  factors enter as **tracked manual overrides** during the daily-refresh step
  (goal #4), clearly logged as manual adjustments, OR as future
  data-collection projects — never as features the v1 model silently computes.
  Any manual override must be recorded so its effect on results can be audited
  separately from the model's own output.

---

## 6. DECISION — baseline model + "no edge" reference  ✅ LOCKED

The baseline is the deliberately-dumb reference every future feature must beat.
If a sophisticated feature can't beat a two-line baseline, the sophistication is
noise. A baseline that's secretly clever hides how much work the real features
are doing — so keep it genuinely simple.

### The baseline (EPA-based — SP+ is unavailable in the backtest per §3)
Predict each game's margin from the two teams' **point-in-time EPA
differential**: (home offense EPA vs. away defense EPA) − (away offense EPA vs.
home defense EPA), plus a home-field constant. Compare predicted margin to the
locked/opening spread to pick a side. No weighting scheme, no situational
factors. That's the reference bar.

Join discipline (from Phase 1): predicting week N uses each team's `week=N-1`
(or latest prior) row — NEVER `week=N`, which already contains week N's results.

### The break-even math — the number to memorize
At standard −110 odds you must win **52.38% ATS just to break even** (risk $110
to win $100; the juice eats everything below that line). Consequences:
- **50% is not neutral — it's losing** at the house rate. A naive model at ~50%
  ATS vs. an efficient market is the EXPECTED result, not a failure.
- The viable range is tiny: 52.4% = break-even, 53% = genuinely good, 55% =
  elite/rare. ~5 points separates "losing" from "world-class." Small win-rate
  differences = enormous outcome differences.
- **CLV matters more than win rate, especially early.** Win rate over a few
  hundred games is very noisy (can hit 55% on luck or 50% while genuinely good).
  Beating the closing line is evidence of real edge BEFORE results are known.
  Over small samples, "did I beat the close?" >> "did I win?"

### Expectation-setting (so the first result doesn't mislead)
The EPA baseline will likely land ~50% ATS, maybe slightly under. **That is not
failure — it's an efficient market and a deliberately dumb model.** The
baseline's job is to be the honest floor, not to be profitable. If EPA-alone
gets 50.5% and the first real feature moves it to 51.5%, that 1-point gain is
real signal — visible ONLY because the baseline gave a clean reference. A
*profitable* baseline would be suspicious: more likely a lookahead bug than
genuine edge, given how efficient CFB spread markets are.

### Early-season handling (weeks 1–3)  ✅ include + flag, and the flag must ACT
Include early weeks — they're real betting weeks; dropping them measures a season
you don't actually play (false cleanliness). But EPA off 1–2 games is near-noise
(cupcake opener → looks elite; tough opener → looks broken). So:
- Early-season games (team has < ~3–4 prior games of EPA sample) get confidence
  **capped**, which under §8b sizing means smaller stakes or below-threshold
  no-bet. The thinness of the data mechanically produces smaller bets. The flag
  FEEDS bet/no-bet and sizing — it is not a decorative report column.
- **Week 1 input (no prior-season-week EPA exists) — ✅ DECIDED (2026-08-01), see ARCHITECTURE.md §23.**
  Took option (a): prior season's final EPA as a rough prior
  (`backtest_harness.get_prior_season_final_stats()`), confidence capped —
  a week 1 pick can never read as "standard," regardless of edge size,
  because the input itself is known-weak (roster turnover, transfer
  portal), not because the edge looks large. Explicit in the card output
  (`uses_prior_season_data`, `flagged_prior_season_data`) and on the
  dashboard (a dedicated banner, not just the per-row pill) — never
  silent. Re-ran the full backtest after wiring this in rather than
  assuming it was neutral: all-predictions ATS unchanged (51.1%), bet-subset
  moved 51.3%→51.1% (closer to all-predictions, not further — shrinks the
  gap §14 already flagged as not real signal). Conclusion unchanged: every
  slice still sits at or below the 52.4% breakeven line.

## 7. OPERATIONAL WORKFLOW (from owner goals #3, #4, #5, #8, #9, #10)

### Locked contest lines (goal #3)
- When SplashSports contest spreads are uploaded (~Tuesday), those become the
  **permanent reference lines** for the week. Store them explicitly flagged as
  contest-locked, distinct from market opening/closing lines.
- Subsequent market movement is tracked ONLY to measure CLV against the locked
  line — it does NOT change the official picks' reference number.

### Daily refresh with fixed lines (goal #4)
- Reassess daily using late-breaking info: injuries, weather, coaching changes,
  motivation, travel, roster availability.
- Picks may change, but ALWAYS measured against the original locked contest
  number, never a re-pegged line.
- Late-breaking qualitative factors enter as logged manual overrides per §5b —
  recorded so their effect is auditable separately from the model.
- V3 records each Tuesday-through-Saturday refresh as a new immutable card
  version. Every locked game carries prior/new side, Confidence, rank, Top 5,
  prediction, and fallback values with explicit change flags; the revision also
  stores a UTC timestamp, reason, author, provenance, and source category.
- A `data_refresh` may change the data snapshot but not model logic,
  configuration, code, contest policies, adjustment history, or locked-line
  snapshot. A `contextual_adjustment` retains the exact model run and requires
  new append-only adjustment history. Contest-line corrections use the
  separate `data_correction` category and preserve the original lock.

### Weekly betting card output (goal #5)
- Full slate: every lined FBS game with side, confidence (1–5), rationale.
- Ranked **Top 5** by the active versioned reliability policy, never raw edge
  unless future out-of-sample evidence supports it.
- Clear separation of recommended-bets vs. contest-only/no-bet (per §5 field).

Every generated card also carries a frozen reproducibility manifest: code SHA,
model and feature-schema versions, configuration version, all active contest
policy versions, data and locked-line snapshot hashes, UTC generation time, and
an as-of hash of the append-only manual-adjustment history. The selection
policy stores its ordered named-book fallback inputs, not only a version label.
A prior card is accepted as reproduced only when those stored inputs regenerate
the exact immutable picks, Confidence values, and Top 5 ranks.

### Confidence-pool pick'em league (SECOND contest consumer)
A separate weekly league: pick 5 games ATS, rank them 5-4-3-2-1, standard
confidence-pool scoring (5 pts for the #1-ranked pick if correct, down to 1 pt
for the #5). Choose any 5 from ~90% of the slate. Lines fix ~Tuesday and don't
move (same locked-line pattern as SplashSports §3).

**This is a NEW CONSUMER of model output, not a second model.** The model
produces per-game predictions/edges once; SplashSports, this pick'em ranking,
and bankroll bets are all different *views* of that same output. Build it as a
thin layer that reads existing per-game predictions and formats them — never a
parallel prediction engine that could drift from the main one.

- **Upload flow:** ingest the ~Tuesday fixed lines (CSV or paste: game +
  spread), join to predictions via the existing team-name resolver, evaluate
  every allowed game against THOSE locked numbers (not live market).
- **Rejected historical proposal:** rank by raw edge. The walk-forward analysis
  in `ARCHITECTURE.md` §19 found no monotonic relationship between edge size and
  ATS performance; the 10+ bucket was the weakest aggregate bucket.
- **V3 reliability ranking:** map explicit model `uncertainty_points` through
  approved, versioned Confidence thresholds. Rank by Confidence descending,
  lower uncertainty, then locked-line ID only to resolve exact ties. A pick with
  no reliability input receives Confidence 1 and sorts below scored picks at
  that level. Take five when at least five games exist, assigning rank 5 to the
  strongest through rank 1 to the fifth.
- Threshold calibration remains an audit responsibility. The system stores the
  complete immutable policy and provenance; it does not infer thresholds from
  the current card or inflate missing reliability data.

### Post-game audit (goal #8) — a first-class output, not an afterthought
After each week, produce:
- win / loss / push, final scores;
- CLV per pick (locked line vs. close);
- hook analysis (games decided by the half-point / key numbers);
- backdoor-cover analysis;
- identification of logic failures — WHY each pick succeeded or failed;
- scored across ALL predictions (calibration) AND the bet subset (ROI/edge)
  separately, per §5.

### Continuous improvement + versioning (goals #9, #10)
- Do NOT change rules from one surprising result. Require: weekly diagnostics →
  identify *systematic* weaknesses → quantify the adjustment → only then version
  (v2.7 → v2.8) after a COMPLETE audit.
- Model version stamped on every pick/prediction so performance is always
  attributable to a specific model version. (Enables "did v2.8 actually beat
  v2.7?" to be answered honestly.)

### Tone of the system (goal #7)
Be critical, not agreeable. If the data doesn't support a favored play, the
system says so. Confidence must fall out of edge math, never be inflated to
please. (This mirrors the whole build discipline: surface uncomfortable truth
rather than produce agreeable-looking output.)

---

## 8. GUIDING PRINCIPLE (owner's own framing)

Not maximizing number of picks — a disciplined process that tracks performance
objectively, minimizes emotional decisions, measures edge against the market,
and gets more accurate over successive seasons. The contest requires a pick on
every game; the *betting* process bets only real edge. The system serves both
without letting either corrupt the other's metrics.

---

## 8b. UNIT SIZING / STAKING  ✅ LOCKED (v1 approach + graduation path)

Bet size scales with edge — but FAR more conservatively than the math tempts.
This is where a decent model quietly becomes an account-blowing one.

### Why NOT full Kelly (the seductive-but-dangerous option)
The Kelly Criterion gives the mathematically optimal bankroll fraction — BUT
only if the edge estimate is correct. It is brutally unforgiving of
*overestimated* edge: think you have 5% but really have 1% → full Kelly drives
massive drawdowns / functional ruin even while "right on average." A new,
unproven model ALWAYS overestimates its own edge (that's what overfitting does).
Full Kelly on an unproven CFB model ≈ a fast way to lose money even if the model
is genuinely good.

### v1: flat confidence-tier sizing (do NOT use Kelly yet)
There is no evidence yet that the model's edge estimates are calibrated, so v1
must NOT compound an unproven probability into bet size. Tie units directly to
confidence tiers, e.g.:
- confidence 5 → 3 units
- confidence 4 → 2 units
- confidence 3 → 1 unit
- below threshold / no-bet → 0 units
Crude, transparent, and it does not trust the model's edge estimate with money.

### Graduation path: fractional Kelly, only after calibration is PROVEN
Over a season, measure whether 5-confidence plays actually won more than 3s
(calibration — part of the §7 audit). ONLY once confidence tiers are shown to
track real results do you graduate to **fractional Kelly** — and even then use
quarter-Kelly (0.25x) or less, never full. Fractional Kelly keeps most of the
growth benefit with far less risk and is forgiving of the estimate error that
will always exist.

Sequencing principle (same as the whole project): a confidence rating is a
*claim*; Kelly sizing *trusts* that claim with money; verify the claim against
real results before trusting it. Flat tiers now, Kelly once the audit earns it.

### HARD GUARDRAIL (all methods, non-negotiable): max bet cap
No single game exceeds a fixed ceiling of bankroll (≈2–3% for a new system),
regardless of what the model or Kelly says. Circuit breaker against a single
confident-and-wrong pick, a data bug feeding a garbage edge, or the model going
haywire. (This session showed how a silent bug produces confident-looking
garbage — the cap stops that garbage from costing the account.)

---

## Later features (parked — do NOT build now, keep in view)

Added one at a time, each measured against the baseline:
- Coach ATS situational splits: as underdog, off a bye, first year at a new
  program. (Raw career coach ATS% is mostly noise / small-sample — use
  *situational* splits with a plausible mechanism, not overall records.)
- Rest / schedule spots (bye weeks, short weeks, 3rd straight road game).
- Rivalry / letdown / look-ahead motivational spots.
- Success rate + havoc (once weekly-backfilled per §3).
- Book-name normalization (DraftKings/Draft Kings, 3× Caesars labels) — needed
  before any "track one book's line over time" analysis.
