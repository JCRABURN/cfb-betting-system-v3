fetch_odds.py
Pulls current spreads, line movement, and juice from The Odds API.
Stores opening and current lines for CLV tracking.

Runs more than once a week now (see .github/workflows/midweek_line_pull.yml
-- Thursday/Saturday, in addition to the original Tuesday pull), which is
what the gambling/pool drift views (models/gambling_view.py,
models/pool_view.py) need: a later same-book number to compare an opener
against. Week/year detection used to read the latest data/stats/week_*.json
file fetch_stats.py had just written -- but that directory is gitignored
and never survives a GitHub Actions checkout, so a Thursday/Saturday run
(which does NOT re-run fetch_stats.py -- no need to, this week's games are
already in the committed data/cfb.db from Tuesday) would always fail with
"No stats files found." Now calls fetch_stats.get_current_week() directly
and checks the DB for this week's games, so it has no dependency on
whether fetch_stats.py ran earlier in the SAME job.
